A Monero specialized fork of SatSale Please support via the Monero Community Crowdfunding System . try.xmrsale.org xmrSale is currently under early development, always manually check significant payments . xmrSale is a self-hosted Monero payment processor, serving two primary use cases: 1. Donation button for your website that you can easily embed/link to anywhere. 2. Monero payment gateway, including a Woocommerce plugin that easily turns ANY Wordpress site into a Monero accepting store. xmrSale makes donation buttons simple - easy copy paste the one line HTML iframe into your site. With a simple Python backend to talk to your own Monero node, xmrSale uses RPC to generate new addresses, and monitors the payment status with your own copy of the blockchain. Features Process payments with your own Monero node via RPC and SSH. Monero core, or any other node software that supports RPC calls. Direct peer-to-peer payments without any middleman. No KYC, and greater privacy than donation systems where Monero addresses are reused multiple times. Lightweight and highly extendable, basic html and css stying. Modular Python backend, take a look at the code . Natively extendable to all Monerod node features (e.g. segwit) through RPC. QR codes, customizable required payment confirmations and payment expiry time. Privacy ensured. Monero only. Contributions See the Github . Pull requests welcome. Disclaimer xmrSale is in very early development. As such, we are not responsible for any loss of funds, vulnerabilities with software, or any other grievances which may arise. Always confirm large payments manually. Support Thank you for your continued support on the Monero Community Crowdfunding System (CCS). You can also support the satSale project as we relied on it heavily as a code base.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#home","text":"xmrSale is a simple, easily deployable, lightweight Monero payment processor that connects to your own Monero node.

It is best that we create a new subdomain like xmrsale.yoursite.com from which we can serve payments.

If you don't have a node, you can follow the Docker installation below which will install one for you. Or you can install one yourself. While you can run xmrSale on the same machine as your Monero node, a separate VPS for xmrSale is recommended. Install (with node) Clone and install dependencies git clone https://github.com/xmrsale/xmrSale cd xmrSale/ pip3 install -r requirements.txt Connect to your Monero Node Edit the config.py configuration and point to your Monero node: host = \"127.0.0.1\" monerod_rpcport = \"18081\" monerowallet_rpcport = \"18090\" monerod_username = \"MONERODRPC_USER\" monerod_password = \"MONERODRPC_PASS\" wallet_username = \"WALLETRPC_USER\" wallet_password = \"WALLETRPC_PASS\" You can find these monerod rpc details in monero.conf or in daemon arguments within your systemd .service . To be able to connect to your node with full ability to create addresses, we need to have a monero wallet RPC service running alongside our monerod RPC. Note most node guides do not install this by default, including sethforprivacy's. To run monero-wallet-rpc with arguments, it is probably easiest to run this as a service like you may have done for your monerod daemon. We will just create a similar .service , here is an example monerowallet.service . You can set the wallet RPC login as arguments in this file. Connecting to a remote node is easy and can be done over SSH tunneling or tor hidden services (tor not yet working), you can do this manually with ssh root@IP -q -N -L 18081:localhost:18081 & ssh root@IP -q -N -L 18090:localhost:18090 & or whatever ports you're using. Make sure your ssh connection is working (without prompts!). Further config examples can be found in docs/ . Run xmrSale Run xmrSale with gunicorn -w 1 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 xmrsale:app Gunicorn is a lightweight python HTTP server, alternatively you can run with just python xmrsale.py though this is not recommended for production. That's it! You should now be able to view your xmrSale server at http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000/ . If running locally, this will be 127.0.0.1:8000 . If running on a Raspberry Pi, you will want to forward port 8000 in your router settings so that xmrSale is also visible at your external IP address. You might have to allow gunicorn through your firewall with sudo ufw allow 8000 . You will want to run gunicorn with nohup so it continues serving in the background: nohup gunicorn -w 1 0.0.0.0:8000 xmrsale:app > log.txt 2>&1 & tail -f log.txt Install (with Docker) A beta docker image is now working but has not yet been security vetted and is not ready for production use, it is packaged with a Monero node for an easy installation: For testing: git clone https://github.com/xmrsale/xmrSale cd xmrSale/ Edit docker-compose.yml with links to your Monero wallet file and blockchain directory (if applicable). Then docker-compose up --build it will have to sync with the Monero blockchain which may take some time.
